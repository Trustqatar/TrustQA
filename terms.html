    <h2>Verification and Authenticity</h2>
    <p>TrustQA employs various methods to verify the authenticity of reviews and content. However, we cannot guarantee that all content is completely accurate or free from errors. Users are encouraged to exercise their own judgment when making decisions based on information provided through our Service.</p>
